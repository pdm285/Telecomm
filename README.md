## Setup

1. Go to [https://teleworld.headspin.io/mysettings](https://teleworld.headspin.io/mysettings)
2. Retrieve your HeadSpin API Token
3. Put that token into line #2 of the `resources/config.json` file
4. Set "headspin:capture" to "true" if you want to capture performance of the test (default is false). This setting is in the individual script at this time.

- At the moment, the script can't click the 'join' button for some reason. Still investigating the cause.
